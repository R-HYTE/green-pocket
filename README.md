# Description
This project is built using MongoDB as its database, ExpessJS and NodeJS in the backend, and REACT library in the frontend.

I opted to use dotenv package because the project has some environment variables that are safeer if not exposed in a public repository.

The `.env` file in the backend folder will have variable like:
```
PORT={insert a port number here}
MONGO_URI={insert the connection uri to your database}
...
``` 

# Install
Your environment should have node  and npm installed
``` bash
sudo apt install node npm
```

## Access the codebase
Navigate into the project folder
``` bash
cd green-pocket
```
